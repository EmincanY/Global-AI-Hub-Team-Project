Global AI Hub - Deep Learning Bootcamp Final Project
UrbanSounds8K is a large file which is included .waw files.
We created spectrograms for all .waw files and then labelled their classes via UrbanSounds8K.csv.
Later we extracted our features and create a DF with them.
After we split train-test-validation data, we created a model and fit them with train data(we also validated with validation data).
Finally, we used our test data to look at our accuracy score and we optimized that by changing hyperparameters
